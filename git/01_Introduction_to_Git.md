# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, track changes, and manage different versions of code.

## Local vs. Remote Repositories
- **Local Repository**: A repository stored on your local machine.
- **Remote Repository**: A repository hosted on a server, used for collaboration (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- Local repositories are used for local development, while remote repositories facilitate collaboration.

## Benefits of Using Git
- Track changes in code over time.
- Work collaboratively with other developers.
- Revert to previous versions if needed.
- Branching allows you to develop features in isolation.

## Basic Concepts
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes in the codebase.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository, useful for working on new features.
- **Repository**: A storage space for your project and its history.

## Examples
```bash
# Initialize a new local repository
git init

# Clone a remote repository
git clone <url>
